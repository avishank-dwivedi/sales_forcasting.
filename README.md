## 📁 Dataset

We used a simple dataset with the following columns:

| Date       | Sales |
|------------|--------|
| 2021-01-01 | 1542   |
| 2021-01-02 | 1601   |
| ...        | ...    |

✅ **Date** – the date of the sale  
✅ **Sales** – total sales on that date

## 📊 What We Did

1. Cleaned the dataset  
2. Visualized the data using graphs  
3. Trained a time series model (like ARIMA)  
4. Predicted sales for the next 30 days

## 📈 Results

- The model predicted sales values for future days  
- We created graphs to compare **actual vs predicted sales**
